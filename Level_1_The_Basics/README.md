# Level 1: The Basics (Dense Networks)

In this level, we explore the foundations of TensorFlow and Keras using simple Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. `Tensorflow01.ipynb`
* **Concepts:** Basic tensor operations, creating a simple neuron.
* **Goal:** Understanding the input/output relationship in a single neuron.

### 2. `Tensorflow02_with_callbacks.ipynb`
* **Dataset:** Fashion MNIST (Grayscale images 28x28).
* **Architecture:** Deep Neural Network (DNN) using `Dense` layers.
* **Key Feature:** Implemented a **Custom Callback** to stop training automatically when accuracy reaches **95%** to prevent overfitting.
* **Result:** Achieved target accuracy and analyzed the variance between training and testing data.
