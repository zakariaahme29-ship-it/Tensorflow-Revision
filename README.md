## 📚 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by levels of complexity, acting as a step-by-step course:

### 🔹 [Level 1: The Basics (Dense Networks)](./Level_1_The_Basics)
Focuses on the fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
* **Key Concepts:** Tensors, Dense Layers, Optimizers, and Loss Functions.
* **Projects:**
    * `Tensorflow01.ipynb`: Introduction to Neurons and simple linear regression.
    * `Tensorflow02_with_callbacks.ipynb`: **Fashion MNIST** classification using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with **Custom Callbacks** to handle overfitting.

### 🔹 [Level 2: Computer Vision (CNNs)](./Level_2_Computer_Vision) *(Coming Soon)*
Moving from simple dense layers to **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
* **Focus:** Convolutions, Pooling, Image Augmentation, and Transfer Learning.
* **Goal:** Building models that can "see" and classify complex images efficiently.
